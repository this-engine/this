// This example demonstrates easy, cross-platform usage of OpenGL ES 3.0 functions via
// QOpenGLExtraFunctions in an application that works identically on desktop platforms
// with OpenGL 3.3 and mobile/embedded devices with OpenGL ES 3.0.

// The code is always the same, with the exception of two places: (1) the OpenGL context
// creation has to have a sufficiently high version number for the features that are in
// use, and (2) the shader code's version directive is different.
